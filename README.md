## Introduction
This repository is designed to provide examples and explanations of advanced C++ concepts. Whether you're a seasoned developer looking to refine your skills or a student aiming to learn more about C++, this project will offer valuable insights.

## Features
- Example code snippets
- Practical use cases

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, clone the repository to your local machine:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/narenbakshi/Advanced_tutorial_CPP.git
```

Navigate to the project directory:

```sh
cd advanced-cpp-concepts
```

Compile and run the examples using your preferred C++ compiler. For instance, using `g++`:

```sh
g++ -o example examples/example.cpp
./example
```

## Concepts Covered
### 1. STL Containers
- **Vector**: Dynamic array implementation.
- **List**: Doubly linked list.
- **Map**: Key-value pairs with unique keys.
- **Set**: Collection of unique elements.
- **Stack**: LIFO data structure.
- **Queue**: FIFO data structure.

### 2. Operator Overloading
- Overloading operators for custom behavior.

### 3. Templates
- Function templates
- Class templates

### 4. Function Pointers
- Using pointers to functions for callback mechanisms.

### 5. Object Slicing
- Understanding object slicing and how to prevent it.

### 6. Abstract Classes
- Defining and using abstract classes with pure virtual functions.
